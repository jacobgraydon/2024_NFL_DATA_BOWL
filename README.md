"Files Calculate Distance.R" and "Finding Open Field Tackles.R" are the example files for how we ran through all 9 weeks to identify open field tackles. These files are isolating one game for ease. All outputs are "Week_1_Output.csv","Week_2_Output.csv","Week_3_Output.csv",
"Week_4_to_6_Output.csv","Week_7_to_9_Output.csv". After unioning these files together, we begun exploratory analysis with nflverse data. A lot of the graphs were made in "Exploratory Analysis.R".
